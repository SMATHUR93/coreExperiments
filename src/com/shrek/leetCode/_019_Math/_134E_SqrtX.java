/**
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
 *
 * You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
 *
 * For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 0 <= x <= 231 - 1
 *
 * Hint 1
 * Try exploring all integers.
 * Hint 2
 * Use the sorted property of integers to reduced the search space.
 *
